         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If a Man lie ſick to death, and his Sonne wish him dead, this is ſinne in the Sonne, although his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire concurre with the ſecret will of God; becauſe the Sonne ought to deſire the perſervation of his Fathers life; whereto the will of God revealed in his word obligeth him: and, <hi>vivendum

The ſecond Book is, <hi>[The Hiſtory of Independency,]</hi> vvherein I ſhevv the <hi>Riſe, Growth, and Practiſes of that Party;</hi> vvhich being full of ſchiſmaticall quick-ſilver, reſtleſſe and ſtirring, and tenable by no Oaths, Principles, Promiſes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, nor by any obligations or Lavves divine or humane, doth novv enjoy the fruits of their perfidiouſneſſe and treachery, a Conqueſt gotten over their Adverſaries by pretending, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and falſe promiſing, vvhich they attribute to the Bounties and Mercies of God: and from the ſucceſſe of their villanies argue moſt Turkiſhly his bleſſings over them; and as Ievviſhly arrogate to themſelves to be the peculiar People and Saints of God, although he uſeth them but as a Rod in his hand to ſcourge the ſinnes of the other Party, and of the vvhole Kingdome. It is the uſuall method of Gods juſtice not onely to puniſh one ſinne
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35822:5"/> by another, but one Sinner by another; nay, a leſſer Sinner by a greater: and at laſt to receive the humble and corrected Sinner into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and caſt the inſulting Executioner of his vvrath into the fiery fornace of his anger. In my aforeſaid <hi>[Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Independency]</hi> you have that Faction conquering: In this <hi>Continuation</hi> or <hi>Supplement</hi> of the ſaid Hiſtory, I repreſent them to you triumphing, uſing and abuſing their Victories to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, deſtruction of the King, beggering and enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Kingdome, depriving us of our Religion, Lavves, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Eſtates, and conſequently, making our VVives and Children the objects of our feare, deſpair, and ill boding doubts, not the objects of any comfort and joy vve can take in them, vvhoſe miſeries vve foreſee, but cannot help. VVhen I conſider the intricacy of this my undertaking, hovv perplexed it is, hovv intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled vvith various changings, counterchangings, revolutions, revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and betrayings of Parties, (ſuch are all Civill VVarres, but eſpecially thoſe vvhere the moſt unciviil and barbarous ſort of men, the dregs and lees of the People ſvvim a top) hovv full of diviſions, and ſubdiviſions; in ſo much that they vvho are Friends and hold together in one Intereſt or Faction, are Oppoſites in another. Methinks my labour is as vaine as his that attempted to take the Picture of <hi>Proteus;</hi> or his, that endeavoured to ſhape a Garment for the Moone: vvhen God brought a Confuſion but of Lips and Tongues upon <hi>Babel,</hi> vvhat Man vvas able to reduce them into order againe?

VVhat Hiſtorian can find a method in ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall a <hi>Chaos?</hi> can dravv light out of ſo palpable a darkneſſe? Beſides, I foreſee my revvard to be envie, hatred, malice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ſlanders, ſequeſtration, beggery, impriſonment, and at laſt an Arbittary death vvithout any Legall Tryall, proceedings, Iury, Iudges, or Court, or any knovvne eſtabliſhed Lavv to judge by; <hi>Obſequium amicos veritas odium parit.</hi> I have already follovved truth ſo neer at the heels (although but a private retainer to her) that almoſt all my teeth are ſecretly ſtricken out: vvhat dare they not novv doe openly againſt me? ſince by murdering our King; diſ-inheriting his Poſterity, ſubverting Monarchicall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, aboliſhing the Houſe of Lords, and perverting the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35822:5"/> Houſe of Commons, ſetting up nevv Repreſentatives, vvith Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Legiſlative Povver, and nevv Courts and Iuriſdictions againſt all Lavves, they Proclaime themſelves Conquerours of King, Parliament, and Kingdome, Victors of our Religion, Lavvs, Liberties, &amp; Properties, &amp; Triumphers over our Perſons, VVives, Children, and Eſtates? ſince they profeſſe their vvill &amp; povver, to be the only Lavvs &amp; Rules of their doings, and our ſufferings. But vvhen I conſider, that as no mans innocency, ſo no mans reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can protect him; but that ſome men muſt die (according to <hi>Catiline's</hi> rule) to make up the number, others to multiply confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, others to ſatisfie private ſuſpitions, malice &amp; revenge, &amp; many muſt die to cement and foment this nevv erected Tyranny vvith their bloud, I thought it as eaſie &amp; more honourable to die vvaking and vvorking for my God, my King, and Country, than to die ſleeping, and have my throat cut in a Lethargy. I knovv theſe Schiſmaticks thirſt as much after bloud, as they hunger after mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: and I am ſure to be involved in the common and inevitable ruine of my Country, vvhy ſhould I not rather periſh for it novv, them vvith it hereafter? It is more manly, more noble, more Chriſtian; <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum eſt pro patria mori;</hi> vvas the ſaying of an Heathen, vvhy not of a Chriſtian? Religion, Lavves, and Liberties, lie novv at ſtake; vvhy ſhould not I come in for a Gameſter? it is a mixt cauſe, and he that dies for it is a Martyr. He that feares Death, muſt be a ſlave to thoſe Tyrants that carry rhe Svvord; he that feares Poverty, muſt be a Villaine to thoſe <hi>Iudaſſes</hi> that beare the Purſe; but he that feares God, vvill bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv ſtrength from him to contemne them both: Thus putting my truſt in God, I put Pen to Paper, and my life into the ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, vvhere God (I knovv) holds the ballance: he vvhoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence takes notice of a Sparrovv falling from the houſe-top, vvill vvatch over me, and either protect me againſt them, or receive me from them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>About <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11. 1648.<note place="margin">35. The Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> vvas delivered into the vvorld a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Beggers Brat, called <hi>[The Agreement of the People.]</hi> It is very judiciouſly Anſvvered by Mr. <hi>VVilliam Aſhurſt;</hi> all the Contents thereof is in the <hi>Remonſtrance of the Army,</hi> 20. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1648. vvhereof I have ſpoken already.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It propoſeth, <hi>That the People</hi> (that is, ſome ſmall part of the People, the Army and their faction) vvithout any colour of Lavv or Right <hi>ſhould agree together to take away finally the preſent Government by King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> vvhich the Kings Party heretofore charged upon the Parliament as their Deſigne for vvhich they fought; vvhereupon, the Parliament to vindicate hemſelves, publiſhed many Declaratione, and paſſed ſundry Votes, <hi>That they would not alter the Government by King, Lords, and Commons;</hi> it alſo takes avvay the legall right from Burroughs to chuſe members of Parliament; this admitted, they may as vvell conſpire to take avvay any Lavv, or any mans Life or Eſtate, by vvhich rule vve could enjoy nothing but at the vvill of any number of men that ſhall call themſelves <hi>The People.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ground that thoſe that ſhall ſubſcribe this <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:35822:25"/> may call themſelves <hi>the People,</hi> may thoſe that ſhall refuſe to ſubſcribe call themſelves <hi>the People,</hi> and upon farre better grounds, as being farre the more numerous, and ſtanding for defence of thoſe auntient Lavves, vvhich doe conſtitute the People and Common-vvealth of <hi>England,</hi> vvhich vvill breed infinite confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diviſions: and vvhat thoſe that call themſelves <hi>the People</hi> novv agree to, they may alter upon the next change of humour or intereſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inconveniences of the preſent Government have not yet been plainly diſcovered, nor no Triall hath been made by the preſent knovvne legall povver of <hi>England;</hi> vvhether thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences may not be removed vvithout ſubverting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, and introducing ſo totall a change as vvill be very dangerous and grivous to all ſorts and conditions of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Proteſtation, <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 27. 1643. vve are bound to defend Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to oppoſe and bring to puniſhment all ſuch as ſhall endeavour the ſubverſion of Parliaments, vvhich this Agreement cleerly doth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Agreement encroacheth deſperately upon the liberty of the people of <hi>England,</hi> in the Election of this Repreſentative; depriving them that have conſtantly adhered to this Parliament as vvel as the Kings party (if they cannot in conſcience ſubſcribe it) from Electing, or being Elected; yet they ſhall have Lavves and Taxes impoſed upon them by Subſcribers, vvho are the leaſt, and the leaſt conſiderable party of the Kingdome; and upon vvhom they conferre no truſt; vvhich is to disfranchiſe the Nonſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and reduce them to the condition of Conquered Slaves. It is a knovvne Maxime in Lavv, <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri debet,</hi> vvhat concernes all men muſt be debated and agreed to by all men, either perſonally or repreſentatively.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It vvill raiſe factions and feudes betvveen the Subſcribers and Non-ſubſcribers of the Parliament party.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It takes avvay Magiſtracy and Government, not onely by placing ſuch a Supreme povver over them as is diſputable; nay, apparently illegall: But by making the heady multitude <hi>(the People)</hi> ſupreme Iudges over the ſaid Repreſentative: for although it inflicts the penalty of death upon the Reſiſters of their Orders;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35822:25"/> yet is vvith this <hi>ſalvo,</hi> except ſuch Repreſentative ſhall expreſly violate this Agreement, vvhich makes every man or number of men that ſhall get povver into their hands Iudges of it; nor is there any other Iudge deſigned: and (if there vvere) vvho ſhall judge that Iudge? <hi>&amp; ſic in infinitum,</hi> the legall ſupreme Truſt of all publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que intereſts being taken avvay, our vagabond thoughts vvander in a circle, not knovving vvhere to repoſe our truſt, all Iudges, all Councels may erre, but the raſcall multitude are the very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of errors and corruptions. If therefore the Supreme, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative have ſo unſtable an authority, vvhat ſhall the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magiſtrate acting under them have?</p>
            <p n="7">7. It ſmels ſo much of the Ieſuite, that it tolerateth Popery in private Houſes; contrary to the knovvne Lavves of the Land: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (like the old Serpent) if it once get in the head, vvill ſoon inſinuate the vvhole body, being ſo vvell backed by potent Princes and Councels from beyond Sea. And truly I knovv not vvhat to ſay againſt Popery, vvhere Hereſie, Schiſme, Atheiſme, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie are openly tolerated, and exempted from the povver of the civill Magiſtrate, as in this Agreement.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It vvill loſe <hi>Ireland;</hi> the managing of the VVarre there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legally in this Parliament by Act paſſed, not in this nevvfang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Repreſentative.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It divides us from <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. It deſtroyes the Cauſe for vvhich the Parliament ſo often Declared, Voted, Proteſted and Convenanted that they fought, viz. <hi>Defence of Parliaments, Religion, Lawes and Liberties,</hi> and beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves the Cauſe upon the King, as if He onely (from the beginning) had fought for them: vvhich all men have reaſon to believe, vvhen they ſhall ſee the Parliament make ſuch ill uſe of their Victory, as to root them all up. And this and all other Parliament Armies vvere Commiſſioned <hi>to preſerve this Parliament;</hi> by this Authority they have their Pay and Indemnity, vvithout vvhich they are Thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, Rebels, and Murderers.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It demands, that there be no Lavvyers nor Lavves, but nevv Rules in Engliſh to be made from time to time by the nevv Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, vvho are to be choſen and truſted onely by a ſmall faction of Subſcribers, (as hath been ſaid) according to vvhich juſtice ſhall be adminiſtred, not by Mayors, Sheriffs, Iuſtices of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35822:26"/> the peace, Officers alvvaies ready, but by Hundred Courts, vvho are to ſupply the roome off all the Iudges and Lavvyers of the Kingdome: and all this to lie in the breſts of 12 Men in every Hundred (of the Tribe of the Godly be ſure) vvho peradventure can neither vvritte nor read, nor have reſponſible Eſtates to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vvrongs done: theſe ſhall doe juſtice by providence and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It deſtroyeth all great and publique Intereſts (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſtand) Kings, Lords, Souldiers, Magiſtrates, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Lavvyers, Miniſters, vvho vvill oppoſe it beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="4">4. This violence upon the Members, is not onely contrary to the Armies truſt, but againſt their Covenant and Proteſtation: the breach whereof being a morrall evill cannot be made good by honeſt intentions and neceſſity.</p>

            <p>The onely difference therefore remained upon two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions:

            <p>For Delinquents, though He doth not grant all, His Majeſty conſented <hi>they ſhall ſubmit to moderate Compoſitions, according to ſuch proportions as they and the two Houſes ſhall agree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He diſableth them <hi>to beare Offices of Publique Trust, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves then from the Kings, Queens, and Princes Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For ſuch as the Houſes propounded <hi>to proceed capitally against,</hi> He leaves them to a Legall Tryall; and Declares, <hi>He will not interpoſe to hinder it:</hi> which ſatisfies the maine complaint of the Parliament, which was (in the beginning of the Warre) <hi>That the King protected Delinquents from juſtice.</hi> And all that the Houſe deſired in the Propoſitions preſented to Him at <hi>Oxford, Febr.</hi> 1642. was, <hi>That His Majeſty would leave Deliquents to a Legall Tryall and Iudgement of Parliament.</hi> But that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould joyne in an Act for taking away the Lives or Eſtates of any that have adhered to Him (He truly profeſſeth) <hi>He cannot with Iuſtice and Honour agree thereto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor doe we ſee how Delinquents (being left to the Law) can eſcape juſtice, the King having granted the 1. proemiall Propoſition, &amp; (ſo by a Law) acknowledged the Parliaments Cauſe and Warre to be juſt.</p>
            <p>For the Church. The Houſes propound the utter <hi>aboliſhing of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c.

And whereas, lately the farre major part of the Houſe of Commons, pitying the bleeding condition, and teares of the oppreſſed People, Voted, and entred into a Perſonall Treaty with the King: without which (by the Armies own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in their Remonſtrance at Saint <hi>Albons, p.</hi> 64.) there can be no peace; which the Army interrupted by obtruding upon the Commons a treaſonable Remonſtrance, 20. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1648. tending to deſtroy the King, and His Poſterity, and wholly to ſubvert all Parliaments, Religion, Lawes, &amp; Liberties for ever; whereby the Commons in Parliament found it abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent ſuch pernitious innovations, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding a ſafe peace with His Majeſty; whereupon (after mature debate) the Houſe of Commons the 5. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648.

            <p n="1">1. Whether a King of three diſtinct Kingdoms can be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; executed by one Kingdom alone, without the concurrent conſent, or againſt the judgement of the other two?</p>

Since that the Court hath taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what You then ſaid, they are fully ſatisfied with their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and they hold it fit You ſhould ſtand ſatisfied therewith too: And they do require that You do give a poſitive &amp; particular Anſwer to this Charge exhibited against You; they expect you ſhould eyther confeſſe or deny.

Sir, I must let you know from the Court, that</hi> they are very ſenſible of theſe delaies of Yours, and that they ought not (being thus Authorized by the Supreme Court of <hi>England</hi>) be thus trifled vvithall, &amp; that they might in Juſtice, and according to the rules of Juſtice, take advantage of theſe delayes, &amp; proceed to pronounce Judgement againſt you, <hi>yet nevertheleſſe they are pleaſed to give direction, and on their behalfe, I doe require you,</hi> That You make a poſitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver unto this Charge that is againſt you, in plaine Tearmes <hi>(for

                  <hi>Sir, You have had the reſolution of the Court, upon the like Queſtion the last day, and you were told,</hi> that having ſuch a Charge of ſo high a nature againſt you, Your work was, that you ought to acknowledge the Juriſdiction of the Court, &amp; to anſwer to your Charge, <hi>when you have once Anſwered, you ſhall be heard at large, make the best defence You can: But Sir, I must let You know from the Court, (as their Commands)</hi> That You are not to be permitted to Iſſue out into any other diſcourſes till ſuch time as You have given a poſitive Anſwer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the matter charg'd upon you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen, it is well knowne to all, or most of you here preſent, that the Priſoner at the Barre hath been ſeverall times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and brought before this Court, to make Anſwer to a Charge of High Treaſon, and other High Crimes exhibited against Him, in the Name of the People of</hi> England; <hi>to which Charge being required to Anſwer, He hath been ſo farre from obeying the Commands of the Court, by ſubmitting to their Iuſtice, as He began to take upon Him Reaſoning and Debate unto the Authority of the Court, And to the Higheſt Court that appointed them to Trie and to Iudge Him; but being over-ruled in that, and required to make His Anſwer, He ſtill continued Contumacious, and refuſed to ſubmit to Anſwer. Hereupon the Court (that they may not be wanting to themſelves, nor the Trust repoſed in them, nor that any mans wilfulneſſe prevent Iuſtice) they have conſidered of the Charge, of the contumacy, and of that Confeſſion which in Law doth ariſe on that Contumacy; they have likewiſe conſidered the notiority of the Fact Charged upon this Priſoner; and upon the whole matter, they are reſolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be pronounced against this Priſoner, but in reſpect He doth deſire to be heard before the Sentence be Read, and Pronounced, the Court hath reſolved to hear Him; yet Sir, thus much I must tell You beforehand, (which you have beene minded of at other Courts) that if that which You have to ſay, be to offer any debate concerning the Iuriſdiction, You are not to be heard in it: You have offered it formerly, and you have ſtrook at the root,</hi> that is, <hi>the Power and ſupreme Authority of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>which this Court will not admit a Debate of: and which indeed is an irrationall thing in them to doe, being a Court that act upon Authority derived from them. But Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of Your ſelf concerning the matter charged, the Court hath given me in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to heare You.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>King.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since I ſee that You will not heare any thing of debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which I confeſſe I thought most materiall, for the peace of the Kingdome, and for the liberty of the Subject, I ſhall wave it; but only I must tell you, that this many a day all things have been taken
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35822:54"/> away from Me, but that, that I call dearer to Me than My life, which is My Conſcientie and Mine honour; and if I had a reſpect of my life, more than the peace of the Kingdome, and the liberty of the Subject, certainly I ſhould have made a particular, defence for My life, for by that at leaſtwiſe, I might have delayed an ugly Sentence, which I believe will paſſe upon Me, therefore certainly Sir, as a man that hath ſome understanding, ſome knowledge of the world (if that my true zeale to My Country had not overborne the care that I have for My owne preſervation) I ſhould have gone another way to worke than that I have done: Now Sir, I conceive that a haſty Sentence once paſſed may ſooner be repented of than recalled; and truely, the ſelf-ſame deſire that I have for the peace of the Kingdome and the liberty of the Subject, more than My owne particular ends, makes Me now at last deſire, that I having ſomething to ſay that concerns both, I deſire, before Sentence be given, that I may be heard in the</hi> Painted Chamber <hi>before the Lords and Commons, this delay cannot be prejudiciall to you, whatſoever I ſay, if that I ſay no reaſon thoſe that heare Me must be Iudges, I cannot be Iudge of that that I have: if it be reaſon, and really for the welfare of the Kingdome, and the liberty of the Subject, I am ſure its very well worth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, therefore I doe conjure you, as you love that which you pretend. (I hope its reall) the Liberty of the Subject, and peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that you will grant Me this hearing before any Sentence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but if I cannot get this liberty, I doe protest that your faire ſhewes of Liberty and Peace are pure ſhewes, and that you will not heare your King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Preſident ſaid, <hi>This was a declining the Iuriſdiction of the Court, and a delay:</hi> Yet the Court vvithdrevv for half an hovver, adviſed upon it, and ſate againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaid to the King, <hi>That the Court had conſidered what He had moved, and of their owne Authority; the returne from the Court is this,</hi> That they have been too much delayed by You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and they are Judges appointed by the higheſt Authority, and Judges are no more to delay, than they are to deny juſtice; and notvvithſtanding vvhat You have offered, they are reſolved to proceed to Sentence, and to Judgement, that is their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reſolution.</p>
               <p>The King preſſed againe &amp; againe, that He might be heard by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35822:55"/> the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, and was as often denied by <hi>Bradſhaw:</hi> at laſt, the King deſired that this Motion of His might be entered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> began in a long Speech to declare the Grounds of the Sentence, much aggravating the Kings offences, and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying both Law and Hiſtory to his preſent purpoſe: When <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> had done ſpeaking, the Clerk read the Sentence drawn up in Parchment to this effect:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">84. The Sentence againſt His Majeſty.</note>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Here the Clerk read the aforeſaid Charge.</note> 
                  <hi>Which Charge being read unto Him as aforeſaid, He the ſaid</hi> Charls Stuart <hi>was required to give His Anſwer; but He refuſed ſo to doe: and ſo expreſſed the ſeverall paſſages at His Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in refuſing to Anſwer. For all which Treaſons and crimes this Court doth adjudge, That He the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>as a Tyrant, Traytour, Murtherer, and a publique Enemy ſhall be put to Death by ſevering of His Head from His Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Sentence read, the Preſident ſaid, <hi>This Sentence now read and publiſhed, it is the Act, Sentence, Iudgement, and reſolution of the whole Court;</hi> Here the whole Court ſtood up, as aſſenting to what the Preſident ſaid.</p>

Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Tryall of His Majeſty.</note>This is a Relation of his Majeſties Tryall by a mixed Court of Juſtice erected by 50. or 60. Confederate Members of the Houſe of Commons, ſitting under the power of the Army, after all the reſt of the Members above 250. had been violently ſecured, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, &amp; frighted away: And in order to this deſigne againſt the King, the Houſe of Peers voted downe, and yet the Houſe of Commons (when intire) is no Court of Judicature, nor can give an Oath. Had indifferent men been permitted to take Notes, you had had a more perfect narrative; yet as it is, truth ſhines forth to the confuſion of this bloudy, cheating, tyrannicall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: could they have wrought the King to have ſubmitted to the Juriſdiction of this Arbitrary Court, His example ſhould have been urged as an irrefragable Precedent againſt the lives and liberties of the whole Kingdome, and urged to be of as great Authority, as if He had eſtabliſhed that Court by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that the King is to be looked on as a Civill Martyr dying for the Liberty of the People. And although they have failed of this device, yet they will have ſome other Arbitrary bloudy Inquiſition to cut off the lives (without Law) of ſuch as they deſire to remove, without which this Tyrannous Kingdome of the Saints, or Brambles, cannot ſubſiſt; And therefore on Thurſday, 2. <hi>Februarij, Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> and their Canniball Counſell of Officers projected to get an Act paſſed by their Houſe of Commons (where all their Requeſts, are Commands) to enable the ſaid Councell to hang all ſuch as they ſhall adjudge Diſturbers of the Army,<note place="margin">1. Part of <hi>Englands</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Chaines, <hi>ſub fine:</hi> And the Hunting of the Foxes, &amp;c,</note> although no Members of the Army: they muſt have publique Slaughter-houſes <hi>in terrorem,</hi> as well as private <hi>ad poenam,</hi> the nature of their Cauſe, and their naturall conditions requiring it. <hi>Oliver</hi> is a Bird of prey, you may know by his Bloudy Beake; ſo was his <hi>Prodromus</hi> that Type and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of him, <hi>Iohn of Leyden;</hi> than whom, this Fellow will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove farre more bloudy: you ſee this ſchiſmaticall remnant of one Houſe, have the impudence to uſurp the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to themſelves: And then to tell you, that the Votes of this petty Conventicle (calling themſelves the Commons) are the Law, nay the Reaſon of the Land, thereby deveſting us of thoſe Lawes which ſhall diſtinguiſh us from Slaves, &amp; denying us the uſe of our reaſon, whereby we are differenced from Beaſts, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35822:56"/> expecting an implicite faith &amp; blind obedience from us, to all the Votes of this half quarter of a Houſe of Commons, ſo farre that they Vote obedience to the knowne Lawes (in many caſes) to be Treaſon; &amp; vvhat all our Lavves call Treaſon, they Vote no Treaſon: nay, ſhould they vote a Turd to be a Roſe, or <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s Noſe a Ruby, they vvould expect vve ſhould ſvveare it, and fight for it. This legiſlative Den of Thieves erect new Courts of Juſtice, neither founded upon Lavv nor preſcription, Theaters of illegall tyranny and oppreſſion, to take avvay mens lives Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, for actions vvhich no Lavv makes criminous, nay, for ſuch acts as the Lavves command, vvhere their proceedings are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all our knovvne Lavves and uſages, not <hi>per probos &amp; legales homines,</hi> no Juries, no ſvvorne Judges, authentically choſen, no Witneſſes face to face, no formall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment in vvhich a man may find errour and plead to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Court, or vvhere the Court ought to be of Councell vvith the Priſoner: but the ſame engaged and vovved Enemies are both Parties, Proſecutors, Witneſſes, Judges (or Authorizers and Nominators of the Judges) Actors of all parts upon that ſtage of Bloud.</p>
            <p>The King preſſed earneſtly (eſpecially upon Monday, 22. <hi>Ian.</hi>) to have His Reaſons againſt the Iuriſdiction of the Court heard, but vvas as often denied, He intended then to give them in vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vvhich vvas likevviſe rejected: ſo they vvere ſent to the preſſe.

                     <p>HAving already made my Proteſtations not only againſt the illegality of this pretended Court, but alſo that no earthly power can juſtly call Me (who am your <hi>King</hi>) in queſtion as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, I would not any more open My mouth upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, more then to referre My ſelfe to what I have ſpoken, vvere I alone in this caſe concerned. But the duty I ovve to God in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35822:57"/> preſervation of the true Liberty of My People, will not ſuffer Me at this time to be ſilent: For, how can any free-borne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>England</hi> call life or any thing he poſſeſſeth his owne, if power without right daily make new, &amp; abrogate the old funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Law of the Land, which I now take to bee the preſent caſe. Wherefore when I came hither, I expected that you would have indevoured to have ſatisfied Me concerning theſe grounds, which hinder Me to Anſwer to your pretended Impeachment; but ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will move you to it (though Negatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot judge Me, nor indeed the meaneſt man in <hi>England;</hi> for I will not (like you) without ſhewing a reaſon, ſeek to impoſe a beliefe upon My Subjects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Hereabout I vvas ſtopt, and not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak any more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now I am moſt confident, that this daies proceeding cannot be warranted by Gods Law, for on the contrary the authority of obedience unto Kings is clearly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and ſtrictly commanded both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which if denied, I am ready inſtantly to prove: and for the queſtion now in hand, there it is ſaid, That <hi>where the word of a King is, there is Power; and who may ſay unto him, what doest thou? Eccleſ.</hi> 8.4. Then for the Lawes of the Land, I am no leſſe confident, that no learned Lawyer will affirme that an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can lie againſt the KING, they all going in His name; and one of their Maxims is, <hi>That the King can doe no wrong.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Law upon which you ground your proceedings, muſt either be old or new; if old, ſhew it; if new, tell what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity warranted by the fundamentall Lawes of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Judicature, which was never one it ſelfe (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to judge; And it were full as ſtrange that they ſhould pretend to make Lawes without King or Lords Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And admitting, but not granting, that the People of <hi>Englands</hi> Commiſſion could grant your pretended power, I ſee nothing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35822:57"/> you can ſhew for that; for certainly you never asked the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tenth man of the Kingdome, and in this way you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly wrong even the pooreſt Plough-man, if you demand not his free conſent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your pretended Commiſſion without the conſent at leaſt of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of every man in <hi>England,</hi> of whatſoever quality or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which I am ſure, you never went about to ſeek, ſo farre are you from having it. Thus you ſee that I ſpeake not for My owne right alone, as I am your King, but alſo for the true Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all My Subjects, which conſiſts not in ſharing the power of Government, but in living under ſuch Lawes, ſuch a Government as may give themſelves the beſt aſſurance of their lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their goods. Nor in this muſt or doe I forget the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of both Houſes of Parliament, which this daies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings doth not onely violate, but likewiſe occaſion the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt breach of their Publike Faith (I believe) ever was heard of, with which I am farre from charging the two Houſes: for all the pretended Crimes laid againſt Me, beare date long before this late Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in which I having concluded as much as in Me lay, and hopefully expecting the two Houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement thereunto, I was ſuddenly ſurpriſed, and hurried from thence as a Priſoner, upon which accompt I am againſt My will brought hither, where ſince I am come, I cannot but to My power defend the ancient Laws and Liberties of this Kingdome, together with My owne juſt Right, then for any thing I can ſee the higher Houſe is totally excluded.</p>
                     <p>And for the Houſe of Commons, it is too well knowne that the major part of them are detained or deterr'd from ſitting, ſo as if I had no other, this were ſufficient for Me to proteſt againſt the lawfulneſſe of your pretended Court.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, the peace of the Kingdome is not the leaſt in My thoughts, and what hopes of ſetlement is there ſo long as power reigns without rule of Law, changing the whole frame of that Government under which this Kingdom hath flouriſhed for many hundred years, (nor will I ſay what will fall out in caſe this lawleſſe unjuſt proceeding againſt Me doe go on) &amp; believe it the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not thank you for this change, for they will remember how happy they have bin of late yeares
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35822:58"/> under the Reigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King my Father, and My ſelfe, untill the beginning of theſe unhappy troubles, and will have cauſe to doubt that they ſhall never be ſo happy under any new. And by this time it will be too ſenſibly evident, that the Armes I took up were onely to defend the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, againſt thoſe who have ſuppoſed My power hath totally changed the ancient Government.</p>
                     <p>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons, why I cannot ſubmit to your pretended Authority without violating the truſt which I have from God, for the welfare and liberty of My People; I expect from you either cleare Reaſons to convince My Judgement, ſhewing Me that I am in an errour (and then truely I will readily anſwer) or that you will withdraw your proceedings.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>ALL worthy Officers and Souldiers who are yet mindfull that you engaged not as a meer mercinary Army, hyred to ſerve the Arbitrary ends of a Councell of State; but tooke up Armes in Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſcience in behalf of your own, and the peoples juſt Rights and Liberties; you may ſee plainly by the proceedings of Col. <hi>Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> with his Regiment that the deſigne of your grand Officers is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Army to a meer mercinary and ſervile temper, that ſhall obey all their commands, without ſo much as asking a queſtion for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. Intending by this blind obedience in you to make you he whatſoever they ſhall find requiſite to eſtabliſh their owne abſolute power over the Common-wealth yea though it be to cut off your beſt friends, or perpetuate this their owne Parliament and Councell of State, things ſo evidently deſtructive to your owne and the peoples juſt Rights and Liberties as nothing can be more.</p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:35822:84"/>
                     <p>And for compaſſing whereof, you know they have long ſince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Agitators, and erected a Councell amongſt themſelves, by which they have moulded the Parliament and a Councell of State to their owne wills; both which, are to be as aſcreen between the People and your Grandees, to make the world believe, they doe nothing but by order of Parliament, and Councell of State, when they order all things themſelves; and indeed are confederated together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and protect each others in their defrauding and enſlaving the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>This they have long aymed at, but cannot poſſibly effect it, untill they reduce the Army to a ſervile and baſe temper, which they have been laboring to bring to paſſe a long time; as by picking quarrels with moſt Officers and Souldiers, that have manifested any ſence of Common Right, and ſo vexing them and wearying them out of Troops and Companie. And (you know) they have been more than once diſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding twenty of a Troup, upon pretence of eaſing the publique charge: all their miſchief being ever done, after either faſting, and prayer, or upon ſome very ſpecious pretence; but the care and reſolution of the honeſt Officers and Souldiers ever preuented this.</p>
                     <p>But now the buſineſſe for <hi>Ireland</hi> (it ſeems) muſt doe the deed; that being a ſervice that muſt be preferred before the ſetling of the Liberties and Freedomes of this Nation: and all that are not for this ſervice muſt be eſteemed no better than Enemies and Traytors; and therefore an <hi>Ahab-like</hi> Faſt goeth before the Lots are caſt: and Col. <hi>Hewſon</hi> falls to worke and diſbands all thoſe Souldiers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that refuſed to engage for the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>England</hi> (which we never trod under foot) be reſtored to the people.</p>
                     <p>The end of this being to be a leading caſe to all other Regiments both Horſe and Foot; not that they certainly intend for <hi>Ireland,</hi> but by ſuch meanes to be rid of all ſuch as are apt to deſire to be ſatisfied in their Conſciences of the juſtice of the Cauſe before they engage in the killing and ſlaying of men any more; or before they ſee ſome fruits anſwerable to the bloud that hath been ſpilt.</p>
                     <p>And being rid of this kind of Officers and Souldiers, then to fill the Regiments as this <hi>Hewſon</hi> doth, with ſuch ignorant, needy, or ſervile men as theſe miſerable times (through loſſe of Trade) have begotten.</p>
                     <p>And this being done, then to make more ſtrict enquiry after this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35822:84"/> ſort of people in the Army, and all other places, ſuppreſſe Meetings, and if that will not doe, then to diſarme all from whom they ſuſpect the leaſt repining or oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>And therefore all thoſe Officers and Souldiers, and all people in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are concerned in a very high nature, even as much as the freedome of the Nation is worth; yea, as they tender the good of their VVives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Families and Poſterity, to venture their lives and all they have, to make oppoſition againſt this the greateſt miſchiefe that ever was attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the greateſt Treaſon that ever was committed againſt the liberties of the people: and not to ſtand any longer in a miz-maze between hope and feare; for if this deſigne take place, your great Officers and their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in Parliament and Councell of State, will be as ſo many Kings, Princes and Lords, and your ſelves, and all the people, their Slaves and Vaſſals.</p>
                     <p>Therefore keep every man his place and poſt, and ſtirre not, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately chuſe you a Councell of Agitators once more to judge of theſe things; without which we ſhall never ſee a new Parliament, or ever be quit of theſe intolerable burdens, oppreſsions, and cruelties, by which the People are like to be beggered and deſtroyed.</p>

                  <p>WE have not yet forgot your Solemne Engagement of <hi>Iune</hi> 5. 1647. vvhereby the Armies Continuance as an Army vvas in no vviſe by the vvill of the State, but by their ovvne mutuall Agreement: And if their ſtanding vvere removed from one Foundation to another, (as is undeniable) then vvith the ſame they removed from one Authority to another; and the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Bonds of the Firſt vvere all Diſſolved, and gave place to the Second; and under, and from the head of their firſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz:</hi> By the VVill of the State, the Army derived their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Martiall Lavv; vvhich in Iudgment and Reaſon could be no longer binding then the Authority (vvhich gave being there to) vvas binding to the Army: For the deniall of the Authority,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35822:85"/> is an Abrogation and Nulment of all Acts, Orders, or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by that Authority as to them: And upon this account, your Excellency vvith the Army, long proceeded upon the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a nevv Councell and Government, contrary to all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Lavv and Diſcipline, by vvhom onely the Army Engaged to be Ordered in their proſecution of the ends, to vvit, Their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Rights, both as Souldiers and Commoners, for vvhich they aſſociated; Declaring, Agreeing, and Promiſing each other, not to Disband, Divide, or ſuffer themſelves to be Disbanded or Divided, vvithout ſatisfaction and ſecurity in relation to their Grievances and Deſires in behalf of themſelves and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-vvealth as ſhould be agreed unto by their Councel of Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators: And by vertue, and under Colour of this Eſtabliſhment, all the Extraordinary Actions by your Excellency, your Officers, and the Army have paſt: Your refuſall to Disband, diſputing the Orders of Parliament; Impeachment and Ejection of Eleven Members; your Firſt and Second March up to <hi>London;</hi> your late violent Excluſion of the Major part of Members out of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and their Impriſonment vvithout Cauſe, &amp;c. vvhich can no vvay be juſtified from the Guilt of the higheſt Treaſon, but in the accompliſhment of a righteous end, <hi>viz:</hi> The enjoyment of the benefit of our Lavves and Liberties vvhich vve hoped long ere this to have enjoyed from your hands; Yet vvhen vve conſider and herevvith compare many of your late carriages both tovvards the Souldiery and other Free People; and principally your Cruell Exerciſe of Martiall Lavv, even to the Sentence and Execution of Death upon ſuch of your Soldiers as ſtand for the Rights of that Engagement, &amp;c. And not onely ſo, but againſt others not of the Army; vve cannot but look upon your defection and Apoſtaſie in ſuch dealings, as of moſt dangerous Conſequence to all the Lavvs and Freedoms of the People.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, although there had never been any ſuch ſolemn Engagement by the Army, as that of <hi>Iune 5.</hi> 1647. vvhich vvith your Excellency in point of duty ought not to be of the meaneſt obligation. VVe do proteſt againſt your Exerciſe of Martial Lavv, againſt any vvhomſoever, in times of Peace: vvhere all Courts of Iuſtice are open, as the greateſt encroachment upon our Lavves &amp; Liberties that can be acted againſt us; and particularly, againſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35822:85"/> the Tryall of the Souldiers of Captaine <hi>Savages</hi> Troup yeſterday, by a Court Martiall, upon the Articles of VVarre, and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of tvvo of them to death; and for no other end (as vve under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) but for ſome diſpute about their Pay: And the reaſon of this our Proteſtation, is from the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> made in the third yeare of the late King, vvhich declareth, <hi>That no perſon ought to be judged by Law Martiall, except in times of VVarre; And that all Commiſsions given to execute Martiall Law in time of Peace, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Lawes and Statutes of the Land.</hi> And it vvas the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments complaint, That Martiall Lavv vvas then commanded to be executed upon Souldiers for Robbery, Mutiny, or Murder. VVhich <hi>Petition</hi> of Right this preſent Parliament in their late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the 9. of <hi>February</hi> and the 17. of <hi>March,</hi> 1648. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend as the moſt excellenteſt Lavv in <hi>England;</hi> and there promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to preſerve inviolably, it, and all other the Fundamentall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves and Liberties, concerning the preſervation of the Lives, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and Liberties of the people, vvith all things incident the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto. And the Exerciſe of Martiall Lavv in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in time of Peace, vvas one of the chiefeſt Articles for vvhich the E. of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> loſt his Head: The ſame by this preſent Parl. being judged High Treaſon. And the Parliament it ſelf, neither by Act nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, can juſtly or vvarrantably deſtroy the Fundamentall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Principles of the Common Lavv of <hi>England:</hi> It being a Maxim in Lavv and Reaſon both, that all ſuch Acts and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, are <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null, and void in Lavv, and binds not all, but ought to be reſiſted &amp; ſtood againſt to the death. And if the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Authority may not preſume to doe this, much leſſe may You, or Your Officers preſume thereupon; For vvhere Remedy may be had by an ordinary courſe in Lavv, the Party grieved ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have his recourſe to extraordinaries. VVhence it is evident, That it is the undoubted Right of every Engliſhman (Souldier, or other) that he ſhould be puniſhable onely in the ordinary Courts of Iuſtice, according to the Lavvs and Statutes of the Realme in the times of Peace, as novv it is; and the extraordinary vvay by Courts Martiall, in no vviſe to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Yea the Parliaments Oracle, Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> Declares in the third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> Chap. of <hi>Murder, That for a Generall or other Officers of an Army, in time of Peace to put any man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

The Solemne Engagement of the Army at <hi>New-market,</hi> and <hi>Triploe-heaths</hi> by them deſtroyed, the Councell of Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors diſſolved, the blood of War ſhed in time of Peace, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners for Common Freedome ſuppreſſed by force of Arms, and Petitioners abuſed and terrified, the lawfull Triall by <hi>12</hi> ſworn Men of the Neighbourhood ſubverted and denied, bloody and tyrannicall Courts (called an high Court of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and a Councell of State) erected, the power of the Sword advanced and ſet in the Seat of the Magiſtrates, the Civill Lawes ſtopt and ſubverted, and the Military intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, even to the hoſtile ſeizure, impriſonment, tryall, ſentence, and execution of death, upon divers of the Free People of this Nation, leaving no viſible Authority, devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all into a factious Juncto and Councell of State, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping and aſſuming the name, ſtamp, and Authority of Parliament, to oppreſſe, torment and vex the People, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the lives, liberties, and eſtates, are all ſubdued to the Wills of thoſe Men, no Law, no Juſtice, no Right or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no caſe of Grievances, no removall of unjust barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Taxes, no regard to the cries and groanes of the poore to be had while utter beggery and famine (like a mighty torrent) hath broke in upon us, and already ſeized upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parts of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore through an inavoidable neceſſity, no other meanes left under Heaven, we are enforced to betake our ſelves to the Law of Nature, to defend and preſerve our
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35822:89"/> ſelves and Native Rights, and therefore are reſolved as one Man (even to the hazard and expence of our lives and fortunes) to indeavour the redemption of the Magiſtracy of <hi>England,</hi> from under the force of the Sword, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> to ſet the unjuſtly impriſoned free, to relieve the poore, and ſettle this Common-wealth upon the grounds of Common Right, Freedome, and Safety.</p>
                  <p>Be it therefore known to all the free People of <hi>England,</hi> and to the whole world, that (chuſing rather to die for Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than live as Slaves) We are gathered and aſſociated together upon the bare accompt of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> with our Swords in our hands to redeem our ſelves and the Land of our Nativity, from ſlavery and oppreſſion, to avenge the blood of War ſhed in the time of Peace, to have juſtice for the blood of M. <hi>Arnold</hi> Schot to death at <hi>Ware,</hi> and for the blood of M. <hi>Robert Lockyer,</hi> and divers others who of late by Martiall Law were murthered at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And upon this our Engagement in behalf of the Common-wealth, We doe ſolemnly agree and proteſt, <hi>That we will faithfully (laying all ſelf reſpects aſide) endeavour the actuall reliefe &amp; ſetlement of this diſtreſſed Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that all the world may know particularly what wee intend, and wherein particularly to center and acquieſce for ever, not to recede or exceed the leaſt <hi>punctilio, We do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare from the integrity of our hearts, that by the help &amp; might of God we will endeavour the abſolute ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this diſtracted Nation, upon that forme and Method by way of an Agreement of the People,</hi> tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Peace-offering by Lieut. Colonel <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Will: Walwyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Prince,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Rich: Overton,</hi> bearing date <hi>May 1. 1649.</hi> the which we have annexed to this <hi>our Declaration</hi> as the Standard of our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35822:89"/> Engagement, thereby owning every part and particular of the Premiſes of the <hi>Agreement,</hi> promiſing and reſolving to the utmoſt hazard of our Lives and Abilities, to purſue the ſpeedy and full Accompliſhment thereof, and to our power, to protect and defend all ſuch as ſhall Aſſent or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here thereunto: And particularly, for the Preſervation &amp; Deliverance of L.

                  </p>
                  <p>And that till ſuch time as by Gods Aſſiſtance we have procured to this Nation the Declared purpoſe of this our Engagement, we will not Divide nor Disband, nor ſuffer our ſelves to be Divided or Disbanded, reſolving with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe and civility to behave our ſelves to the Country, to wrong nor abuſe any man, to protect all to our power from violence and oppreſſion in all places where we come; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſtop the payment of all Taxes or Seſſements what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as of Exciſe, Tythes, and the Tax of Ninety thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds <hi>per menſem.</hi>

                  <p>And concernings the <hi>equity, neceſſity, &amp; juſtice</hi> of our undertaking, We appeale to the judgement of the oppreſſed, betwixt their Deſtroyers and Vs; Whether by the law of God, of Nature, and Nations, it be not equally juſtifiable in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35822:90"/> us <hi>to engage for the Safety and Deliverance of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it was with the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> and other People for theirs, and that upon the ſame Principles that the Army engaged at <hi>New-market</hi> and <hi>Triploe-heaths;</hi> both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Army declaring, <hi>That it is no reſiſtance of Magiſtracy to ſide with juſt Principles, &amp; Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations: And that the Souldiery may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hold the hands of that Generall, who will turn his Cannon againſt his Army, on purpoſe to deſtroy them: The Sea-men the hands of that Pilot, who wilfully runs his Ship upon a Rock.</hi> And therefore, (the condition of this Commom-wealth conſidered) we cannot ſee how it can be otherwiſe eſteemed in us. And upon that account we Declare, <hi>that we doe owne, and are reſolved to owne all ſuch Perſons, either of the Army or Countries, that have already, or ſhall hereafter, riſe up and ſtand for the Liberties of</hi> England, <hi>according to the ſaid Agreement of the People:</hi> And in particular, <hi>We doe owne &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow the late proceedings in Colonel</hi> Scroops, <hi>Col.</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, <hi>and Major General</hi> Skippons <hi>Regiments, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their Reſolutions publiſhed in print; As</hi> One Man, <hi>Reſolving to live and die with them, in their &amp; our juſt and mutuall defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we doe implore and invite all ſuch as have any ſenſe of the Bonds and Miſeries upon the People; any Bowels of Compaſſion in them, any Piety, Juſtice, Honour, or Courage in their Breſts, any Affections to the Freedomes of <hi>England,</hi> any love to his Neighbour or Native Country, <hi>to riſe up,</hi> and <hi>come in</hi> to help a distreſſed miſerable Nation, to breake the <hi>Bands of Cruelty, Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and ſet the People <hi>Free.</hi>
                  </p>

            <p>About this time Doctor <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> a Civill Lawyer,<note place="margin">159. Doct <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> ſtabbed to death in <hi>Holland.</hi>

               </note> Report was made from the Councell of State to the Houſe of the examination of 3.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the principall occaſion of making the ſaid Act. The</hi> Commons in their <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> 15. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1642. complaine, That the King had diſſolved all former Parliaments againſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of both Houſes of Parliament: <hi>wherefore to prevent
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35822:114"/> the Diſſolution, Prorogation, or Adjournment of this preſent Parl. by the Kings Regall Power, after the</hi> Scots <hi>Army ſhould be disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and before the things mentioned in the Preamble could be effected, was the ground and occaſion of this Law:</hi> and not any fear of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the Parliament by the Kings death, Naturall, or Violent, which is confeſſed by the Commons in the ſaid Remonſtrance, <hi>Exact Collect.</hi> pag. 5. 6. 14, 17. compared together, where they Affirme, The abrupt diſſolution of this Parliament is prevented by another Bill, &amp;c. In the Bill for continuance of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>there ſeemes to be ſome reſtraint of the Royall power in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Parliament; not to take it out of the Crown, but to ſuſpend the execution of it for this time,</hi> and occaſion onely, which was ſo neceſſary for the Kings own Security, and the Publique Peace, that without it we could not have undertaken any of thoſe great Charges, but muſt have left both Armies to diſorder, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The very Title of this Act [an Act to prevent inconveniencies which may happen by the untimely Adjourning, Proroguing, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this preſent Parliament] intimates as much, compared with the body of it, which provides as well againſt the Adjourning, or Proroguing without an Act, as againſt a Diſſolution. Now the Parliament cannot be ſaid to be Adjourned, or Prorogued untimely by the Kings Death (which never Adjourned, or Prorogued any Parliament) but onely by his Proclamation, Writ, or Royall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the Houſes, or their Speaker executed during his life time.</hi> See Parl.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Prologue of the Act implies as much, whereas great ſummes of Money muſt of neceſſity be ſpeedily advanced</hi> for relief of His Majeſties Army (not his Heire or Succeſſour) and for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying other His Majeſties (not his Heires, nor Succeſſours) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, which cannot be ſo timely effected, as is requiſite, without credit for raiſing the ſaid Monies; which Credit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained untill ſuch Obſtacles be firſt remoued, as are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Fears and Jealouſies; <hi>That this Parliament may be Adjourned, Prorogued, or Diſſolved, before Iuſtice ſhall be duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:35822:115"/> upon Delinquents</hi> (then in being, as <hi>Strafford, Canterbury,</hi> not ſince made) <hi>Publique Grievances</hi> (then complained of, as Star-chamber, High-commiſſion, Ship-money, Knight-hood Money, Tonnage, and Poundage, &amp;c.) redreſſed: <hi>Peace concluded</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, <hi>ſufficient proviſions made for repayment</hi> of the ſaid Monies (not others ſince) ſo to be raiſed. <hi>All which expreſſions related only to His late Majeſty, as to His Acts of Royall Power, not to His Heires and Succeſſours, after His Naturall (much leſſe) Violent death,</hi> which was not then thought on, but publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deteſted, and Proteſted againſt; no Man being ſo hardy as to mention it for fear of the Law, not then ſubdued by the Sword; And the ſeverall Principall Scopes of this Act are fully ſatisfied long before the late Kings Death.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is cleer by the Body of this Act;</hi> And be it declared, &amp;c. That this preſent Parliament, &amp;c. <hi>Shall not be diſſolved, unleſſe it be by Act of Parliament to be paſſed for that purpoſe; nor ſhall at any time,</hi> or times during this preſent Parliament, <hi>be Adjourned, or Prorogued,</hi> unleſſe it be by Act of Parliament to be paſſed for that purpoſe; and that the Houſe of Peeres ſhall not at any time, or times, during this preſent Parliament, be Adjourned, unleſſe it be by themſelves, or by their owne Order. And in like manner, <hi>That the Houſe of Commons ſhall not at any time,</hi> or times be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, &amp;c. as aforeſaid. From whence it is undeniable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That this Act was onely to prevent untimely Diſſolving, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing, and Adjourning</hi> of that preſent Parliament then Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and no other, <hi>by Acts of Royall Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the King was the Principall Eſtate, and Member,</hi> yea, our Soveraign Lord, the ſole Declarer, and Enacter of this Law, by Aſſent of the Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That neither this Act, nor any other, for Diſſolving, Prorogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Adjourning this Parl. could be made without the Kings Royall Aſſent,</hi> which the Lords and Commons in their Remonſtrance, 26. <hi>May,</hi> 1642. often acknowledge, together with His Negative Voice to Bills, <hi>exact Collect.</hi> p. 69. 70. 736. 709. 722.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That it was not the Kings intent in paſſing this Act to ſhut Himſelf out of Parliament,</hi> or create Members of Parliament without a King, as He profeſſeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:35822:115"/> and make themſelves a Parliament without Him, as their ſaid Remonſtrance teſtifies; and the words of the Act import, <hi>much leſſe was it their intent to pack a Parliament of</hi> 40. <hi>or</hi> 50. <hi>Commons onely, ſelected by Colonell</hi> Pride, <hi>to Vote according to the Dictates of a Councell of Warre,</hi> after they had deſtroyed the King, and Houſe of Peeres: <hi>Againſt which tranſcendent uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very Act provides, That the Houſe of Peers ſhall not be ſo much as Adjourned, or Prorogued, but by themſelves, or their own Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Neither did the King, Lords, and Commons, in paſſing this Act intend, That by Murdering the King, Aboliſhing the Houſe of Lords, and expelling by power of the Sword eight parts of ten of the Commons, the remaining Faction ſhould conſtitute themſelves, their Heires and Succeſſours, a Perpetuall Parliament,</hi>

Relation 85. <hi>Dyer</hi> 85.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The laſt Clauſe of this Act concludes as much. And that all, and every thing, or things whatſoever done, or to be done (to wit, by the King; or His Authority) for the Adjournment, Proroguing, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of this Parliament,</hi> contrary to this preſent Act, ſhall be utterly voide and of none effect. <hi>Now Death of the King, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this Parliament thereby cannot properly be ſtiled a thing done, or to be done by the King, if by thoſe Words (things done, or to be done for the diſſolving, &amp;c.) they ſhall ſay, they related to the Kings Naturall Death;</hi> Natural Death is the Act of God, which theſe Saints cannot make voide, <hi>if they related to His violent Death, it could not then be ſaid a thing done, or to be done for the unlawfulneſs, and injuſtice of it. This Act paſſed long before any War, or Bloud ſhed;</hi> The onely pretence they have ſince found out for the Kings Murder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Parliament were not Diſſolved by the Kings Death, <hi>Yet the Houſe of Peeres (formerly Voted) downe by the Commons, gave no conſent the paſſing this Act,</hi> Entituled, <hi>An Act of the Houſe of Commons;</hi> who, without the concurring Aſſent of the Lords, and the Kings Royall Aſſent, have no power to paſſe any Act, Make, or Declare any Law, or impoſe any Tax, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the fore-recited Acts; The <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> The <hi>Act
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:35822:116"/> for the Trienniall Parliament,</hi> and this very Act againſt Diſſolving, Proroguing, &amp;c. with all our Printed Statutes, Parliament Rolls, and Law-Bookes. The Commons being ſo farre from claiming the ſole Legiſlative Power heretofore, as that they were not Summoned to our Ancient Parliaments, (which conſiſted onely of King, Lords, Temporall and Spirituall) untill 45 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. nor had they ſo much as a Houſe of Commons, or Speaker, untill the Reigne of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. nor never tendred any Acts, or Bills to the King, but Petitions onely of Grievances, untill long after <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. time.

            <p n="5">5. When the King had two Armies in the Field, and many Garriſons, this whole Army conſiſted but of 22000. Men, and had an Eſtabliſhed pay but of 45000<hi>l.</hi> a Moneth.

But when the Army (by confederacy with their Party in the Houſe) took the boldneſſe to encreaſe their number without Order, 60000<hi>l.</hi> a Moneth was thought abundantly ſufficient to pay the Army, and take off Free-quarter: and why this Tax ſhould now be raiſed to 90000<hi>l.</hi> a Moneth, when ſundry Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it are Aſſigned for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and yet Free-quarter conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, is a myſtery of Iniquity which fills the Saints Pockets with Money, and all the World with Wonder.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Counties Militia (ſo much contended for with the King) would better defend the Kingdome from Forraign Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then a Mercinary Army. Therefore there is neither neceſſity, nor publique utility in keeping up this Army, or raiſing Taxes to maintaine them, or pay their pretended Arreares. The Free-quarter they have taken in kind, and leavyed in Money, will treble their Arreeres, and make them much indebted to the Country. Thus farre (and much farther) Maſter <hi>Pryn,</hi> whoſe

The ſaid Agreement made between the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchicall Independent Party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the maſſacring Antimonarchicall Popiſh Party under <hi>Owen Roe Oneale</hi> (being a meer conſpiracy to root out Monarchy and Proteſtancy: firſt, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then in <hi>England:</hi> and a ſecond crucifying of Chriſt in his members between two Thieves, the Schiſmatique and the Papiſt) was ſo generally abhorred by the Engliſh Souldiery, that many there tooke occaſion to forſake the Engliſh Parliament; and many here disbanded rather than they would accompany <hi>Cromwell</hi> in ſo wicked an expedition. Wherefore <hi>Cromwell</hi> writ Letters to his Creatures of the Councell of State by <hi>Monke</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, complainig how much the miſcarriage of that Agreement had retarded his ſaid Voyage; deſiring them (for ſatisfaction of the Souldiery and People) to Treat with <hi>Monke</hi> to take the whole buſineſſe upon himſelfe, and to cleer the Councell of State, the Parliament, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelfe, from having any hand at all in it, which upon Tearmes of ſafety and advantage (he ſaid) he already found him inclinable to doe. The better to carry on the ſcene, this Agreement was with much heat of zeale complained of in the Apocryphall Houſe of Commons by a Brother who had his cue beforehand, and by the Iuncto was referred to the Councel of State as was forelaid, where their High and Mightineſſes (after ſome private conference with <hi>Monke</hi> to accommodate the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) voted their diſlike of it:<note place="margin">

                        <salute>To my Worthy Friend, SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOu may wonder my Obligations being ſo great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that my returnes of acknowledgment ſhould be ſo ſeldome as they have been, but you muſt know there is no defect in my deſires to be at your eares often; 'tis onely the preſervation of my Liberty and Safety in theſe parts that makes me forberare the frequency of ſuch intercourſes. I am confident theſe Letters, this Meſſenger and the incloſed Papers, which I here ſend you, (containing a true Copie of the Propoſitions and Letters of Agreement between <hi>Owen Roe O Neale,</hi> and Col. <hi>George Monke</hi>) will be able to give you ſome accompt of the paſſages in theſe parts, and will make you aſſured that I doe not forget the reſpects I owe unto you.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſſe to you that (as you ever conceived) I never could imagine that the Parliament proceedings would have advanced to ſo high a degree of rage and wickedneſſe, as I ſee they are now come to, and are reſolved to act by: but being amazed at the KING'S Murther, and ſeeing the Gangrene doth ſo cruelly ſpread, I will impart to you my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:35822:123"/> reſolution, That I am reſolved to get into your parts with the firſt conveniency, and adhere to you there, whoſe actions are more conducing to the preſervation of our Religion, Law, and Common Intereſt, than any where elſe, that I can find. But that this my ſo ſudden reſolution may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the fruit of ſome vaine feare, miſcarriage in my ſelf, or light deſires to abandon my former principles; I ſhall give you a right underſtanding of all the motions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of my ſoule, ſince I was acquainted with this late Treaty between Col. <hi>Monke,</hi> and <hi>Owen Roe O Neale,</hi> that thereby you may judge of the ground of theſe my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and diſtaſts, and my reſolutions taken thereupon.</p>
                     <p>And before I conſider the particulars of the Treaty, the thing it ſelfe is ſo odious unto me, that if they could have made the beſt bragaine to be imagined for the Engliſh Safety, the manner of it would have appeared to me very unſavory.</p>
                     <p>For although it cannot be denied that almoſt the whole Iriſh Party (in regard of their Confederacies, and Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) have not been innocent in all particulars of that vaſt Ocean of Engliſh Blood that hath been ſhed; yet it is moſt cleer that the Plotters and Contrivers of this Treaſon, and the unnaturall and butcherly Executioners thereof, are that Party principally, which are now Headed by <hi>Owen O Neale;</hi> for, although many of the pale, with others of <hi>Conaught, Leinſter,</hi> and <hi>Munſter</hi> entertained the Deſign, when they ſaw it was ſo far ſpread, and the Engliſh ſo much weakned in their Perſons and Poſſeſſions, yet it cannot be denied but this Kingdome had ſtill many moderate-minded Men, that loathed their Country-mens barbarity, and could never be drawne to adhere to their Party in their leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Parliament Agents, to gather up theſe Men
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:35822:124"/> (and theſe onely) that have been drunke with the blood of their Brethren, and to fortifie them with Armes, Councels, and conjunction of Forces, that thereby they may preſerve to themſelves the Triumphs of their Cruelty and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to lap them up in their affections with promiſes of reward, if they will perſevere to act with the ruine of the KING and Monarchy, the deſtruction of the remnant of the Engliſh Proteſtants, and the antient Iriſh who have now declared their Loyalty; and ſubmitted to, and conſociated with them, are things that I much loathe, and can no way imbrace.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, if you conſider the paſſages of the Treaty, you will eaſily be drawne (I ſuppoſe) to caſt away your former enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſcruples, and not condemne me for being out of love with mine.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> For firſt. The Title to <hi>Owen Roes</hi> Propoſitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all other of his Nation but ſuch as will joyne with him, though they be farre more capable of Peace and Pardon than himſelf, or his Party.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> He and his Party who in a late Paper of theirs, ſtiled the Parliament of England, <hi>Monſtroſum Parliamentum,</hi> (the monſtrous Parliament) when (as then) it had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared it ſelfe with Royall, Sacred, and Noble Blood, as ſince it hath done: yet now where he ſees them act like himſelfe, he hath taught his tongue to quaver, and calls them, <hi>The moſt Honourable and potent Parliament;</hi> when all Honour is perſecuted by them, and no power exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by them but brutiſh violence, and extreame tyranny.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> In the ſecond Propoſition: That an Act of Oblivion be paſſed to extend to all and every of <hi>Owen O Neales</hi> Party for all things done ſince the Yeare, <hi>1641.</hi> You ſhall find that <hi>Monke</hi> approves of it totally, without the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of puniſhment to any the moſt bloody Plotters and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:35822:124"/> Murtherers whatſoever that are in that Crew, which makes me more in love with my Lord of <hi>Ormonds</hi> peace than I was before.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>4.</hi> 'Tis propounded by <hi>Owen Roe;</hi> and approved by <hi>Monke,</hi> That he shall have a Sea-port to himſelfe, to make uſe of, for the perfecting of his deſignes, when (as we heare) the leaſt Traffick will not be allowed to you in <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>5.</hi> Although <hi>Col. Munke</hi> doe a little pare his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the Repealing of Statutes againſt Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques ſince <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> leſt he should offend the People: And though he doe not abſolutely undertake to grant him all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors Lands (which when he is once ſtiled <hi>O Neale,</hi> he will challenge to be the ſix eſcheated Counties) yet by <hi>Monkes</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is aſſured, that he shall not receive the leaſt diſadvantage thereby. All which directions, Councels, and aſſurances (I am confident) Col. <hi>Monke</hi> would not have uſed towards him, if he had not had a Parliament-foundation to warrant it.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee theſe Men who lately were utter Enemies, have confederated together to ruine Monarchy and the Proteſtant Religion, meerly to raiſe themſelves, and ſupport their owne Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They will not here allow the KING to make uſe of His owne Subjects to revenge His Fathers blood, to Re-inthrone Himſelfe, to re-eſtablish Religion and the Lawes, and the juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and yet they allow themſelves a latitude of calling in any Party, though the moſt blody and inhumane, to aſsiſt them, in the carrying on their wicked Deſignes.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen Col. <hi>Iones</hi> his Letters, cenſuring the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> for joyning the Irish to his Party (though the beſt and leaſt culpable of them) and yet the ſame <hi>Iones</hi> (whoſe head and hand is in this Treaty and Concluſion) thinks it allowable in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to cloſe with the worſt, and that upon his owne termes. And though Col. <hi>Monkes</hi> hypocriſie (in Correcting <hi>Owen O
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:35822:125"/> Neales 7.</hi> Article) will not allow that unity and amity shall be publickly proclaimed between them; yet he is willing it shall be practiſed, and they shall mutually aſsiſt one another againſt all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers whatſoever, that is, the KING, and all in Authority under Him.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of theſe things hath left ſuch an impreſsion upon my ſoule, that I am reſolved to make ſpeed to you, no way deſiring to live under their Commands, whoſe actions increaſe in horror, and beget new afflictions to all honeſt English hearts.

The word <hi>[Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament]</hi> was a ſurpluſage; for which no Indictment could lie: no Allegiance, no Treaſon; and we owe Allegiance to the King alone; whoſoever Leavyeth Warre in <hi>England</hi> (in the intendment of the Law) is ſaid to Leavy Warre againſt the King onely: although he ayme not at His Perſon, but at ſome other Perſon: And if he that Leavyeth Warre againſt the King.

All which they have lately brought to paſſe; wherefore let all true English-men (as becomes good Chriſtians,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:35822:137"/> good Patriots, and gallant Men) claime their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights; and with one voice crie out.</p>
